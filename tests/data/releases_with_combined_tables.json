      "description": "ENGIE Services Ltd on behalf of North East Lincolnshire Council (the Authority) is seeking a suitably qualified contractor for the upgrade of its CCTV cameras and network.  The Authority's  current public space and council building CCTV camera system has evolved over the last 20 years by using a variety of different technologies to respond to the issues of their aging system to maintain the optimum performance with the limitations afforded with these changes. The Authority have undertaken a full technical evaluation of their current system based on the operational requirements they now face. On the review it has become apparent that the consolidation of the different elements of the system needs to be implemented to allow better management of the CCTV system within the control room, whilst at the same time removing the risk of equipment obsolescence, which is driving the running cost of the system up each year. As a result of the review, The Authority have taken the decision to upgrade their current CCTV system, including the renovation of the current control room to improve the environment within the control room for their operational staff working within this area. the appointed Contractor shall provide the following elements of works: Installation and commission of a new high -capacity wireless transmission network. Installation and commission of a new high-definition cameras. Installation and commission of a new digital CCTV control, recording and display system. Installation and commissioning of new control room. Provide within Prelims, welfare facility and storage container within fence compound area at Doughty Road Depot, area to be agreed with client. Provision of a  comprehensive service and maintenance package. Additionally, the Contractor shall be responsible for all works in relation to any decommissioning, strip out and disposal of the existing CCTV systems and camera locations as per the requirements within the tender documents. All information and documents are only available via www.yortender.co.uk All clarifications and questions must be submitted via www.yortender.co.uk",

          "description": "This tender package and performance specification has been detailed following a thorough evaluation by the Authority and based on the information gained. The tender documents compiled will address the issues raised by the evaluation work undertaken by the Authority. The new design will be a digital based solution, based on the supply, installation, and commissioning of a new high-capacity digital CCTV system with wireless communication from the remote camera locations back to the control room at Doughty Road Depot, Grimsby. The new control room security management system will deploy encryption to secure the data within the system in its active state as well as nonactive state. The nominated system will be provided by Visual Management Systems Ltd (VMS). The new system will manage all cameras and their recordings for 30 days within the control room as part of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirement. Viewing of the system will be via two workstations within the control room, supplementary viewing monitor in the gatehouse reception area, and a playback workstation so that the daily operation within the control room is not disrupted.  Within the new control room there will also be an eight-screen video wall to allow key cameras and information to be presented.  The existing Axis cameras will be retained and merge into the new CCTV system, whilst all other existing cameras will be upgraded to new Axis cameras as specified within the tender documentation. These will then be enhanced by additional cameras in key locations to allow better monitoring of the public space and road system. Currently the cameras communication medium is via the wireless traffic light transmission system to bring all the remote cameras back to the control room. However, due to the bandwidth capabilities of the current communication system, a new wireless solution will be deployed by Rapier Systems to manage the camera data. As well as the wireless system, some sites due to their location, will use alternative transmission solutions to bring the cameras back to the control room.

If an appeal regarding the award of the contract has not been successfully resolved, The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (SI 2105 No. 102) provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by breach of the rules to take legal action.  Any such action must be brought within the applicable limitation period.  Where a contract has not been entered into, the Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order for any document to be amended and may award damages, make a declaration of ineffectiveness, order for a fine to be paid, and/or order the duration of the contract be shortened.  The purpose of the standstill period referred to above is to allow the parties to apply to the Courts to set aside the award decision before the contract is entered into."
